# Data structures and algorithms
## Lab 1
[Set](https://github.com/ciuiseb/UBB/tree/main/Semestrul%202/SDA/lab%201) - implemented using a dynamic vector

## Lab 3 
[MultiDictionary](https://github.com/ciuiseb/UBB/tree/main/Semestrul%202/SDA/lab%203) - implemented using a DLL (with links represented as nodes)

## Lab 4
[Ordered MultiDictionary](https://github.com/ciuiseb/UBB/tree/main/Semestrul%202/SDA/lab%204) - implemented using a DLL (with the links represented in a dynamic array)

## Lab 6
[Rare Matrix](https://github.com/ciuiseb/UBB/tree/main/Semestrul%202/SDA/lab%206) - implemented using a hash table(with collisions resolution using interwoven lists)

## Lab 7
[Binary Tree](https://github.com/ciuiseb/UBB/tree/main/Semestrul%202/SDA/lab%207) - implemented using a LL (with links represented as nodes)
